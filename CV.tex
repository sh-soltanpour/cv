	\item \textbf{ÙŽUndergraduate Research}(Jul. 2019 - Oct. 2019): \\
	\textbf{Real-time verification and evaluation of algorithms efficiency in distributed actor based systems}\\
	Using java language to compile and run Rebeca codes with different policies and measure some metrics to find the best algorithm.\\
	\href{http://rebeca-lang.org/}{\textit{Rebeca}} (Reactive Objects Language) is an actor-based language with a formal foundation, designed in an effort to bridge the gap between formal verification approaches and real applications. It can be considered as a reference model for concurrent computation, based on an operational interpretation of the actor model. It is also a platform for developing object-based concurrent systems in practice.\\
	Under supervision of \textbf{Dr. Fatemeh Ghassemi}.

	\item \textbf{Blockchain, CryptoCurrency and Digital Currencies}	\\
	I've passed \textit{Introduction to Cryptocurrency} course as my master's degree course and I got the mark 20/20. \\ 
	During this course, I studied several essays about Bitcoin, Ethereum and blockchain and did some computer assignments to use make Bitcoin transactions in P2PKH and P2SH modes and broadcast them to the blockchain.
	I also did some computer assignments to make a simple application using Solidity,  web3.js and Truffle framework in order to deeply understand smart contracts.\\
	Under supervision of \textbf{Dr. Behnam Bahrak}.
