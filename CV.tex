	\textbf{Real-time verification and evaluation of algorithms efficiency in distributed actor based systems}\\
	Using java language to compile and run Rebeca codes with different policies and measure some metrics to find the best algorithm.\\
	\href{http://rebeca-lang.org/}{\textit{Rebeca}} (Reactive Objects Language) is an actor-based language with a formal foundation, designed in an effort to bridge the gap between formal verification approaches and real applications. It can be considered as a reference model for concurrent computation, based on an operational interpretation of the actor model. It is also a platform for developing object-based concurrent systems in practice.\\
	Under supervision of \textbf{Dr. Fatemeh Ghassemi}.
